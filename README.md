Considered by most to premier ice hockey league in the world backed by its talent and revenue. This study will break down the last 10 years of Hockey by statistics and finances.

### Motivation
I have lived in the greater Nashville Area since 1997, I was 10. I grew up playing competitve sports and sport videos games in my childhood. I always have had an interest in understanding the how and why behind how major sport teams. In 1999 the city of Nashville enjoyed its first year as a NHL city and I was introduced to Hockey at the highest level. Since that time I have become and avid fan and played multiple NHL licensed game titles. Ive always enjoyed constructing theoretical teams through videogames respective Franchise game modes 
### The why?

* Do multiple bad contracts guarantee a team to not make the postseason and what are said long term effects. (Total value of all players added and lost during the offseason will be used to determine a rating)

Th

I will provide interactive visualizations in Power Bi and/or Tableau that will be filterable by player, team, ratings
