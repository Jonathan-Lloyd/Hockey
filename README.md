# 2011-2021 NHL  Data Analysis



### The NHL?
The National Hockey League (NHL) was formed on November 26, 1917 and only had 8 teams. Since then the NHL has expanded and grown to now include 32 teams across Canda and The United States. Considered by most to premier ice hockey league in the world backed by its talent and revenue. This study will break down the last 10 years of Hockey by statistics and finances.

### Motivation
I have lived in the greater Nashville Area since 1997, I was 10. I grew up playing competitve sports and sport videos games in my childhood. I always have had an interest in understanding the how and why behind how major sport teams. In 1999 the city of Nashville enjoyed its first year as a NHL city and I was introduced to Hockey at the highest level. Since that time I have become and avid fan and played multiple NHL licensed game titles. Ive always enjoyed constructing theoretical teams through videogames respective Franchise game modes 

### The why?
The last two years the Tampa Bay Lighting  have won the league championship, Lord Stanley's Cup. Now, with my recent studies in data analytics I wanted analyze and present findings from real world sources.

#### I will be taking the last 10 years of hockey data, which will include player stats and salaries and develop a grading system. I will then use this data to determine the following:

* What are the average salaries of the each grade given

* How the top 4 teams of each year(ranked by playoff finish) built their teams.

* Do multiple bad contracts guarantee a team to not make the postseason and what are said long term effects. 

#### I then will be taking a deeper dive into individual teams yearly salary breakdowns to find the following

* I will Define Salary Cap rules that have been collectively bargained.

* Does buying out contracts do more harm than good?

* Do state income taxes affect free agency signings of the salary cap?


###### I will provide interactive visualizations in Power Bi and/or Tableau that will be filterable by player, team, ratings
